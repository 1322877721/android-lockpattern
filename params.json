Users can define their own lock pattern ‒ which is a combination of 4+ dots.\r\n\r\nWe have extracted this piece of code from Android source code, [platform/frameworks/base], then modified it a little, to make it easy to use in an application.\r\n\r\n  * **Latest stable: v3.2 (#45)** (January 19th, 2015).\r\n  * *From version `3.1.1 beta (#44)`, this project follows [Semantic Versioning].*\r\n  * The demo can be downloaded on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=group.pals.android.lib.ui.lockpattern.demo). It needs some more permissions to help us monetize it. With this service we are able to create more great apps and libraries for you guys. *Thank you for your understanding.*\r\n  * Latest source is available in the demo app. You can export it directly to SD card or to Google Drive, Dropbox...\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n  * Requires: Android 2.1+ (API 7+).\r\n  * Supports: Eclipse IDE; Android Studio (support is in beta).\r\n  * *No dependencies.*\r\n  * Designed for both *phones and tablets*.\r\n  * Stealth mode (invisible pattern).\r\n  * 5 built-in themes:\r\n    * Dark/Light\r\n    * Light with dark action bar (available from API 7+, but only works from API 14+)\r\n    * Dark/Light dialogs\r\n  * Ability to generate and let the user verify CAPTCHA pattern.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n  * If you're upgrading the library, refer to Migration Notes first.\r\n  * For more information about usage, see Wiki pages.
